##Getting and Cleaning Data Project Codebook - January 2016

The following information is taken/paraphrased from the UCI HAR  dataset readme: 

Source dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Data Set Information: 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The included files are as follows: 

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features (variables).

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The units for variables are as follows: 

Acceleration in the X,Y, and Z directions: standard units g

Angular velocity from the gyroscope are in radians/second 

Body acceleration is calculated by subtracting total acceleration from gravity 

Additionally: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
